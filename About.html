Let There Be Light...box!<br />
ligthbox is an online drawing tool. <br />
the goal is to help artist learn to draw things (especially those outside his/her comfort zone).<br /><br />

there are other goals that we at artJutsu would like to accomplish.<br />
<ul>
 <li>become topical, by sketching views/scene from current affairs and pop culture</li>
 <li>be part of a community of people who think drawing is fun</li>
 <li>learn about new art resources and events</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />
how to use?<br />
lightbox is really easy to use. If you have a tablet, or a mouse you are ready to go. <br />
Just draw, learn and have fun.<br />

Everyday a new picture will be shown by default. And you can compare your version with others from the community!<br />
An idea of mine would be to share any link throughout via lightbox. It would be cool to see a link on your social network with a drawing.
